Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
 --> An inline element does not use the full width of the page and does not enforce line break. A block element 
     on the other hand does both. Also you can't put block elements inside inline elements, infact, Inline elements can
     exist within block-level elements. 

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
 --> An absolutely positioned element allows you to literally place any page element exactly where you want it. 
     You use the positioning attributes top, left, bottom. and right to set the location. Important to note 
     that these values will be relative to the next parent element with relative (or absolute) positioning. If 
     there is no such parent, it will default all the way back up to the <html> element itself meaning it will
      be placed relative to the page itself.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
 --> This can be achieved by setting the margin to auto.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
 --> 3 default block level elements are <p>, <h1>, <div>. Example of 2 inline elements are <span> and <br>. Inline-block is <img>.
    
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
 --> All html element can be seene as box model. It allows to define space between elements. The box model consists of
     margin, border, padding and actual content of the box, for instance text. Padding is like a transparent area around the content but inside of the box.
     The border of the box goes around the padding and content; could be transparent or not. Finally margin is the space between boxes.

     The fix for the box model is to use the CSS property called box-sizing. If we set the box-sizing to border box, 
     it will define the height and the width for the entire box.
